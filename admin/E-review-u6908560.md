### Comments 

1. The best feature of this code is that it has the clear logic.
2. It is well-documented.
3. There is no any class or method structures in this part. It is just written following the logic, therefore, there are some same code repeated more than one time.
4. It does follow Java code conventions and the style is consistent throughout.
5. It is working well and there is no any errors in this code.
