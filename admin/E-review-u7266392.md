### Comments 

1. The best feature of this code is it is an optimistic code and thoroughly as required.

2. Yes The code is well documented with all the requirements to get an easy idea about it.

3. Talking about program decomposition- there is no class present in the program. only one static method is written over there so in my suggestion you can add method for the task you are doing in that function so that it will become more optimistic

4. yes it follows the Java Programming conventions. but it is little bit looking procedural approach so you can add methods for the tasks doing in that program

5. Everything is working fine
